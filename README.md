- Analyze **loss ratios** across provinces, gender, zip codes, and vehicle types
- Select appropriate statistical tests (ANOVA, t-test, Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Interpret significance levels and practical implications
- Generate visualizations to support findings
- Link statistical insights to **business recommendations**

## Main Features
- Clean and robust data loading with error handling
- Normality and variance checks prior to test selection
- Clear summary tables and informative plots
- Final section translating results into strategic insights

## Use Case
Ideal for actuaries, insurance analysts, and data scientists aiming to identify **high-risk segments**, adjust **pricing strategies**, or explore **behavioral patterns** using structured statistical evaluation.
